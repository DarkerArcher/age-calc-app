## Overview

### The challenge

- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I mainly improved my skills writing Vue.js, and especially mobile and responsive designs.

### Useful resources

- [Age calculator](https://www.tutorialstonight.com/age-calculator-in-javascript) - This helped me get the math for calculating ages down. Math isn't really my strong point so it was very useful.
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - This is the documentation for Vue.js. It's very useful and I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn Vue.js.
